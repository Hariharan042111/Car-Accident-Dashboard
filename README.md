# Car-Accident-Dashboard

Project Title : Streamlined Car Accident Data Insights Using an Interactive Dashboard

This interactive dashboard transforms car accident data analysis with real-time insights, dynamic visualizations, and predictive modeling. It enables users to explore accident trends, identify risk factors, and support data-driven decision-making through heatmaps, time-series analysis, and geospatial clustering. Scalable and intuitive, it empowers stakeholders to enhance traffic safety effectively.






1.INTRODUCTION


Vehicle crash
contributes to a significant number of deaths and injuries in human races
around the world. The government and the transportation expert work together
around the clock to lessen the number of injuries and fatalities cause from
vehicle crash issues. To come out with an effective solution whether from
improving the trafficking system including road conditions or increasing
awareness among drivers, the experts must analyse the data of vehicle crash
from the past decades to find the major causes and come out with a decision.
The lack of suitable techniques and tools to analyse a large amount of data is
a deterrent in analysing vehicle crash datasets, and the process costs a lot of
time. Data visualisation is a technique that allows people to display data in a
more infographic form via data visualisation models

POWER BI DEFINE:

Power BI is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work
together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually
immersive, and interactive insights. Your data might be an Excel spreadsheet,
or a collection of cloud-based and on-premises hybrid data warehouses. Power BI
lets you easily connect to your data sources, visualize and discover what's
important, and share that with anyone or everyone you want.
